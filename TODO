### Guidance ###

Stuff that is trivial to implement:

Stuff that can wait:
metadata functions
Next episode suggestion - looks at your DB and suggests three shows to watch next, weighting Watching shows by percentage progress, completed shows by rewatch value and # of times rewatched (tails better than bell), and other shows by length?
Install script that checks for and pulls unsatisfied Perl dependencies?
The project still needs Anime and Manga objects. They will be useful for an option to preserve network traffic rather than memory footprint.
Perhaps disambiguation list should be loaded from an external file, so the user can modify it without diving into code?
Recent activity timeline with buttons for five most recent shows, plus list of activity within the past n days.

Roadmap
=======
(release criteria)

v0.2:
-----
I can click and have an episode I've watched recorded.
Finish coding import (specifically, tags handling) so that the limiter can be removed from the loop, allowing the loop to return the proper error code, which cascades to other functions
Import should (using fillPage?) update the display when it finishes.
Import should display a sayBox with the count of successfully imported/updated titles.
Met 14/09/20: createMainWin should generate the tables fillPage will use, so that menu items, etc., can fill/append to them.
When building title rows, put in button(s) for moving to another status
Options dialog box
Changing options immediately updates all tabs (link to confirmation button, not individual options)
Make sure all SQL update functions use prepareFromHash (for uniformity and easier debugging)
FIX: SQLite can't recognize tables already exist, right now.

v0.3:
-----
Option: display last episode watched, or next episode to watch?
Episode voting

v1.0:
-----
FIX: Some characters cannot be stored/displayed properly, right now.
Storage of alternate titles (including CJK support)
Sanity checking for all input values, specifically those expect to be between, e.g., 0..10.
Episode name recording
Detect movies and put them on their own notebook tab
Allow titles to be arranged in different orders
Main context should create (and pass down) global references for the rows that'll go in the display tables, so that the program can rearrange the display without making SQL calls every time. But only if the net-conserving mode is chosen.
Manga storing of volumes (chapter column in volume table), and automatic update of chapter count when a volume is marked complete (chs/vols, if chapter count in volume == 0)
tab refresh should check to see if there are existing objects (if conserving net traffic) and use those, if possible
tab refresh should be able to refresh just one of the tabs, say 'man', if importing Manga...
