### Guidance ###

For unknown version point:
metadata functions
Next episode suggestion - looks at your DB and suggests three shows to watch next, weighting Watching shows by percentage progress, completed shows by rewatch value and # of times rewatched (tails better than bell), and other shows by length?
Content mapping for series, possibly episodes
Options: content the user cares about (don't ding e.g. violence, if user isn't bothered by it)
Options: mask row type
Install script that checks for and pulls unsatisfied Perl dependencies?
The project still needs Anime and Manga objects. They will be useful for an option to preserve network traffic rather than memory footprint.
Perhaps disambiguation list should be loaded from an external file, so the user can modify it without diving into code?
Recent activity timeline with buttons for five most recent shows, plus list of activity within the past n days.
Storage of additional title information
Start rewatching show button (use undo icon to save button space?)
Display/edit of tags for episode/chapter?
Display/edit of dates started/completed

Roadmap
=======
(release criteria)

v0.3:
-----
Option: display last episode watched, or next episode to watch?
Episode voting
Display/edit of tags for series/pub
Options: If a radiobutton option has more than two options, generate a VBox instead of an HBox

v1.0:
-----
FIX: Some characters cannot be stored/displayed properly, right now.
Storage of alternate titles (including CJK support)
Sanity checking for all input values, specifically those expect to be between, e.g., 0..10.
Episode name recording
Detect movies and put them on their own notebook tab
Allow titles to be arranged in different orders
Main context should create (and pass down) global references for the rows that'll go in the display tables, so that the program can rearrange the display without making SQL calls every time. But only if the net-conserving mode is chosen.
Manga storing of volumes (chapter column in volume table), and automatic update of chapter count when a volume is marked complete (chs/vols, if chapter count in volume == 0)
tab refresh should check to see if there are existing objects (if conserving net traffic) and use those, if possible
tab refresh should be able to refresh just one of the tabs, say 'man', if importing Manga...
Import JSON objects (ImportHum)
Pretty up the display tables
Export of database to XML
Export of database to SQL dump document
Import of content marker files (from other users, who may not have the same numbering?)
Manual entry of titles

v2.0:
-----
plugin registry
option registry
plugins that can add new columns to the display tables
